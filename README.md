# Design Patterns
- Reusable solutions for typical software design challenges are known as design patterns. Expert object-oriented software engineers use these best practices to write more structured, manageable, and scalable code. Design patterns provide a standard terminology and are specific to particular scenarios and problems. Design patterns are not finished code but templates or blueprints only.

## Types of Software Design Patterns
- There are three types of Design Patterns:
1. Creational Design Pattern
2. Structural Design Pattern
